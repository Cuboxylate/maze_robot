# Maze Solving Algorithm

This is the code part of an Electrical Engineering university project.
We built a robot to navigate a maze using infra-red LED eyes to
detect walls.

The code is written in c for the Arduino microcontroller, which 
runs the setup() function and then continuiously loops the 
loop() function.

Included is also a UML activity diagram of the decision making
algorithm.
